This folder is where I keep my daily exercises. It helps me stay active with Python and sharpen my thinking around logic, coding, and problem solving. I also use it as a space to try new libraries and new ways of working.

That is the clear and direct purpose.

There is also a second reason, a softer one, which is to show recruiters how I work and how I think. When I focus only on pipeline building, the work can feel very similar from one task to the next and the process becomes almost automatic. These small exercises push me outside my comfort zone. They force me to look for different paths, especially when I am not allowed to use certain methods and I need to find another way.

Another point is that when someone studies new tools, they do not update their projects every single day. From the outside, on a platform like GitHub, it can seem as if nothing is happening. This folder stands as a small trace of my routine and my study sessions.

This started as a file in Google Colab, but later I understood that Jupyter Notebook gives me far more freedom during execution.
